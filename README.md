How many cores does the WDS server have? We could try to limit the number of logical processors by using the BCDEDIT command-line tool together with the NUMPROC setting. For example, run the following command:
BCDEDIT /set NUMPROC 20

You should be looking for the documentation for running the installation using a response file.
Running Oracle Universal Installer Using the Response File

After creating the response file, run Oracle Univeral Installer at the command line, specifying the response file you created, to perform the installation.

DRIVE_LETTER:\setup.exe_location setup [-silent] "variable=setting" [-nowelcome] [-noconfig] [-nowait] -responseFile filename 
Here is an example of a batch script that I use.

The script runs with a single click to install the Oracle Client.

cd "c:\src\oracle"
powershell Expand-Archive c:\src\oracle\V982658-01.zip c:\src\oracle\
c:\src\oracle\client\setup.exe -silent -showprogress -nowait -noconfig -responseFile C:\src\oracle\client.rsp

Here are some lines from my response file

 ORACLE_HOME=C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\client_1
 oracle.install.client.customComponents=oracle.rdbms.util:19.0.0.0.0,oracle.sqlplus:19.0.0.0.0,oracle.network.client:19.0.0.0.0,oracle.odbc:19.0.0.0.0,oracle.ntoledb.odp_net_2:19.0.0.0.0
